# Dashboard Differences & Use Cases

## Current State

Both dashboards currently show the same data (intake submissions), but in different formats:

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
**Purpose**: Administrative oversight and data management

**Features**:
- Traditional table view (spreadsheet-like)
- Simple white background, clean layout
- Basic submission details
- Focus on **data viewing** and **management**
- Shows: Name, Email, Filing Type, Document Count, Submission Date
- Detail view: Form-style layout with all raw data

**Use Case**: 
- Quick overview of all submissions
- Administrative tasks (exporting data, checking status)
- Simple, no-frills data access
- For office managers or admins who need to see everything at a glance

### Tax Pro Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
**Purpose**: AI-powered strategy discovery and client management

**Features**:
- Card-based visual layout
- Dark theme with holographic panels (Sora-style)
- **Strategy-focused**: Shows "Strategies Identified" and "Potential Savings" on each card
- Client detail page with split layout:
  - **Left (60%)**: AI Insights Panel - Strategy recommendations
  - **Right (40%)**: Metrics Panel - Charts, graphs, key metrics
- Focus on **actionable insights** and **tax optimization**

**Use Case**:
- Tax professionals discovering strategies for clients
- Visual, engaging interface for strategy review
- Quick identification of high-value opportunities
- For tax pros who want to see AI insights at a glance

## Recommended Differentiation

To make them truly different, consider:

### Admin Dashboard Should Focus On:
- ✅ Bulk operations (export, batch actions)
- ✅ Status management (pending, in-progress, completed)
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Data export capabilities
- ✅ System administration

### Tax Pro Dashboard Should Focus On:
- ✅ AI strategy discovery (already implemented)
- ✅ Client prioritization (by potential savings)
- ✅ Strategy recommendations (already implemented)
- ✅ Visual metrics and trends
- ✅ Action items for tax pros
- ✅ Client communication tools

## Recommendation

Since they're currently showing the same data, you could:

1. **Keep both** - Admin for data management, Tax Pro for strategy discovery
2. **Merge into one** - Single dashboard with tabs/views
3. **Enhance differentiation** - Add unique features to each
